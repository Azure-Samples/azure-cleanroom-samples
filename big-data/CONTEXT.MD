## Overview
Azure Confidential Clean Rooms (ACCR) enable secure sharing of privacy-sensitive data by collaborating customer organizations by using confidential computing and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to protect data throughout its lifecycle. This is in preview today and the sample scenarios for the same are available here.
We’re now launching an improved version of ACCR focused on data analytics, which may be useful for customers across all industries, but particularly those in marketing and advertising who may want to analyze large amounts of IP sensitive data across different organizations securely using SQL queries. This version allows Spark SQL queries to be executed in a distributed, multi-node, confidential compute based Apache Spark engine (specifically implemented for ACCR), thus enabling big data analytics in a fully secure and verifiable manner.
Based on the feedback we’ve received from preview, we’ve also simplified the clean room setup/onboarding, membership and contract management in this version by handling these automatically from the ACCR end.

## Personas Involved
### Clean room owner [CO], who:
- Sets up the clean room – hence needs an Azure subscription
### Clean room user [CU], who:
- Can share data and/or queries to the clean room collaboration
- Needs to have a Microsoft (work/school or personal) account to authenticate themselves to use the clean room
